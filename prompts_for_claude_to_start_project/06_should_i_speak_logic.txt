Design the core decision-making function: `should_respond(transcript: List[str]) -> bool`

Purpose:
- Analyze recent dialogue to decide if the VANTA should speak
- Must evaluate:
  - Was a question asked?
  - Did the user speak a keyword (“what do you think”)
  - Is there a long pause or lull?
  - Are repeated topics or goals being referenced?

Use basic heuristics + LLM judgment:
- Run the context through Claude with a system prompt like:
  “You are a quiet but helpful VANTA. Should you say something now? Only respond YES or NO.”

Allow tuning the sensitivity to silence, keywords, or emotional tone.
