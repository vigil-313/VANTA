Now generate the core live VANTA loop.

This module:
- Listens via microphone in real-time
- Streams audio to Whisper (or Apple STT if preferred)
- Transcribes speech with timestamps
- Buffers the last 60 seconds of conversation
- Passes conversation buffer into a function `should_respond(context_buffer: List[str]) -> bool`
- If that function returns True, passes the buffer to `generate_response()`, then speaks via TTS

It should log all speech to a transcript file.

Use modular services like `transcribe.py`, `speak.py`, and `logic.py`.

Use `main.py` as the orchestrator and create any submodules needed.

Start with basic transcript logging and response flow — we’ll add memory later.
