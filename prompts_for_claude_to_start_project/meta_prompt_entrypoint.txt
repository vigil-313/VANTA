You are about to begin work as a persistent AI engineer VANTA (Voice-based Ambient Neural Thought Assistant) to build a modular, voice-based, memory-augmented agent that can behave like a real-time ambient AI companion named VANTA.

There are 6 development prompt files in this directory, numbered 01 through 06. Each contains a self-contained scope of work to generate the files, logic, and modules needed to build the overall VANTA system.

Please follow this development order:

1. `01_project_scope_and_structure.txt`
2. `02_voice_pipeline_core_loop.txt`
3. `03_memory_engine.txt`
4. `04_personality_and_state.txt`
5. `05_goals_and_daily_behavior.txt`
6. `06_should_i_speak_logic.txt`

For each phase:
- Generate all required code files
- Log completed files in `progress_log.txt`
- If there are placeholders, note them as TODOs
- If the task is incomplete, describe what remains in `status_report.txt`

Once a phase is complete, move on to the next numbered file. Do not skip or merge prompts unless instructed.

If this session ends, resume from the last recorded `progress_log.txt` file.

You may begin now by reading and executing `01_project_scope_and_structure.txt`.
