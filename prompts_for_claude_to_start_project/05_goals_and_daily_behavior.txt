Add functionality for goal tracking and autonomous daily behavior.

Features:
- Let the user set goals like “drink water”, “practice mindfulness”
- Log activity streaks in a JSON log (with timestamps)
- Implement daily check-in routine:
  - At a set time, the VANTA should summarize progress, ask reflective questions, and update state
- Add a habit tracker module with:
  - `track_goal(goal_name: str)`
  - `get_progress_report() -> str`
- Daily review triggers `generate_daily_summary()`, which summarizes memory logs

Modules:
- `habits/tracker.py`
- `habits/scheduler.py`
- Extend `main.py` to check time-based triggers

For now use Python timers or loops; cron and OS daemons can be added later.
