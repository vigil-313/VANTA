Design and implement the VANTA's personality and emotional state system.

Features:
- Load VANTA personality from a `persona.json` file
  - Includes name, tone, speaking style, role emphasis (e.g., "advisor", "observer")
- Maintain an `agent_state.json` file that tracks:
  - Daily mood
  - Energy level
  - Focus priorities (e.g., listening, advising, goal tracking)
- Let these values influence the system prompts sent to the LLM
- Allow the state to evolve daily using a `update_mood()` method

Output:
- `persona/persona_loader.py`
- `persona/agent_state.py`
- A base `persona/persona.json` template with sample values
