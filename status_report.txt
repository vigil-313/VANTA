Session: 4 (2025-05-07)
Duration: 22:00 - 22:45

Completed:
- Implemented isolated process architecture for Whisper transcription
- Created robust IPC mechanism for communication with transcription process
- Developed TranscriptionManager with fallback capabilities
- Created a basic fallback transcription service (basic_stt.py)
- Implemented memory limits and resource monitoring for transcription processes
- Added comprehensive error handling and timeout protection
- Created documentation explaining transcription architecture (docs/modules/transcription_architecture.md)
- Created unit tests for all transcription components
- Added test script for validating transcription components

In Progress:
- Remaining voice pipeline features:
  - Language-specific configuration
  - Improved VAD for noisy environments

Next Steps:
1. Complete remaining items from 02_voice_pipeline_core_loop.txt:
   - Implement language-specific configuration for STT
   - Enhance VAD for noisy environments

2. Begin implementing memory engine (03_memory_engine.txt):
   - Design conversation storage schema
   - Implement vector embedding system
   - Create memory retrieval API
   - Develop persistence layer

3. Implement advanced monitoring for transcription services:
   - Error reporting and analytics
   - Performance metrics collection
   - Automated recovery mechanisms

Architecture Decisions:
- Implemented isolated process architecture for Whisper transcription to prevent crashes
- Created multi-level fallback mechanism for transcription services
- Added resource limits to prevent memory leaks and system instability
- Designed IPC protocol for efficient process communication
- Separated speech detection from transcription for better modularity

Project Status:
- Overall project completion: 40%
- Voice Pipeline: 85% complete (remaining language config and noise handling)
- Reasoning Engine: 30% complete
- New files created: 5 (transcription system components)
